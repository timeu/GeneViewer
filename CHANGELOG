March 4, 2011 - Release 0.2.2
   * PJS (Bugfix) : The length of the gene-name is included in the calculation of free-lanes for rendering genes. This avoids overlapping gene-names. 
   * PJS (Feature): Length is replaced by view-region. Previous to this version the default view-region was always from 0 to length. 
                    It's now possible to set an arbitrary view-region. Resetting the zoom will set the zoom to the view-region. 
   * GWT (Feature): Length is replaced by view-region. 
   * GWT (Feature): It's possible to set a geneInfoUrl. In case it is set and a user clicks on a gene a new browser window with the url will be opened.
                    The URL is expected to have a "{0}" placeholder which is replaced with the clicked gene-name (i.e. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=search&db=gene&term={0})
   
February 23, 2011 - Release 0.2.1
	* PJS (Bugfix): Functionality to reset zoom (middle mouse click) was moved to from the mousePressed() to the mouseReleased() function
	                resetting zoom in mousePressed() function can cause problems in Chrome (when the middle mouse is clicked and zoom is reset
	                processing doesn't properly reset call the mouseMoved() function but the mouseDragged() instead. This happens only if the the 
	                zoomResizeEvent is called and in the zoomResizeEvent the GeneViewer is hidden/detached from the DOM)
